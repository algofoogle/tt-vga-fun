# Anton's TT06 grab bag

This is a very simple analog project, created from the [TT06 analog template repo](https://github.com/TinyTapeout/tt06-analog-template).

I am learning to make basic analog designs to submit to TT06, so I'm not sure what you'll find in here ultimately, but so far this is just:

*   A bog-standard CMOS inverter.
*   A simple 8-bit R2R DAC.

# What is Tiny Tapeout?

TinyTapeout is an educational project that aims to make it easier and cheaper than ever to get your digital designs manufactured on a real chip.

To learn more and get started, visit https://tinytapeout.com.

# Analog projects

For specifications and instructions, see the [analog specs page](https://tinytapeout.com/specs/analog/).

*Note*: Analog designs are currently in beta. There's a small chance that the changes will change before the deadline for Tiny Tapeout 6, or that we will have to postpone the analog design support to a future shuttle. If you have any questions, please join the [Tiny Tapeout Discord](https://tinytapeout.com/discord) and ask in the #analog channel.
