## How it works

So far this is just a plain and bog-standard CMOS inverter... maybe a bit on the big side.


## How to test

Provide a digital input on `ui_in[0]`.

Expect to see the inverse output on `uo_out[0]` but also on `ua[0]`.


## External hardware

Probably some sort of X-ray machine to look inside the chip...?
